What is C++?
      
      C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
      
      C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
      
      C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

Difference between C and C++

      The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.\



Let's create our first C++ file.

      #include <iostream>
      using namespace std;
      
      int main() {
        cout << "Hello World!";
        return 0;
      }

 #include-->Directive is used to include a library or header file inur program.
         -->it allows you to use functions, classes defined in that file.
         -->Directive= is a stmt provides instractions to the compiler, and it guides the compilation process.
using namespace std: stmt allows you to access the standard library without explectly specifying the std:: prefix for every element from the standardd library that you use in ur cole.
main is method that is used to execute you code.
cout is function to display the output.
